# ismaellCourse
This is what i coded while taking a course with a friend Ismael Luceno about low level programming, mostly Assembly and C

# Python

* palindromo.py and zetabyte.py: Take a text file "source.txt" and determine if each line is a palindrome or not. The idea was to take a file of many megabytes of text. The exercise was the preparation for the next one.

# C

* palindrome.c: It does the same as the previous file. I appreciate if you let me know if it works, or if you encounter a bug, the only thing I do not see in the code is a "source.txt", but I think it generates the piece of many megabytes with #define CHUNK_SIZE (4 * 1024 * 1024) .

* staircaselejorado.c: Write a ladder of the character '#'.

# Assembly

* printGraphicChar.s Write "Hello World!" the thing is that it's done in assembly.
